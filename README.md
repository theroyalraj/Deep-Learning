# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning Projects

Install
This project requires Python 2.x or Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
MatplotLib
Seaborn
Tensorflow
keras
Sklearn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.7 installer and not the Python 2.x installer. Surprise can then be installed using one of the following commands:

With pip (you'll need numpy, and a C compiler. Windows users might prefer using conda):

$ pip install numpy $ pip install tensorflow

With conda:

$ conda install tensorflow

For the latest version, you can also clone the repo and build the source (you'll first need Cython and numpy):

Code:
A template notebook is provided ipynb format. All the code is included in the notebook, you will be required to use the notebook to implement the basic functionality of the projects.

Run:
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Machine-Learning/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook <name>.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook <name>.ipynb

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and notebook file in your browser.

Data:
Data is provided in the directory in data folder. Which was generated in the competiotion hosted by HackerEarth ML Hackathon(IIT-Madras-Sangam-ML-Hackathon-2019)
